# DataStructures-n-Algorithms
Series of implementations of various data structures and algorithms. **(work in progress)**

The repository consists of:
- Data structures implementations
- Searching algorithms and dynamic programming **(coming soon)**
- Src files corresponding to various problems.

Inside the implementation folder, there is some theory about data structures located in the README
The purpose of this repository is to improve our ability to solve coding problems, for competitions purposes or for anyone having an upcoming technical interview.

Please **feel free to contribute** to this repository so we can grow our number of example exercises, or to improve the content in this repo.
